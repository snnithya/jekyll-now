title: Hi!
---
<p>
I am a musician trained in Hindustani vocal music and an engineering graduate with a B.E. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/">BITS Goa</a>. Any combination of music and technology really excites me and so I spend most of my time working on this intersection. I am currently an R.A. under the guidance of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/prao">Dr. Preeti Rao</a> at the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/course/~daplab/">Digital Audio Processing Lab</a>, IIT Bombay where we are studying the characteristics of raagas in a Jasrangi Jugalbandi. </p><p>  
I also sing and love exploring new kinds of music. I do some amateur recordings every once in a while (feel free to judge me on YouTube or Instagram from the icons below :)). I am also slightly overly obessessed with dogs. I also do spend my time trying to be "artsy" and draw/animate stuff in the process.
So feel free to hit me up if you want to talk about music, tech or even exchange dog pictures :)
