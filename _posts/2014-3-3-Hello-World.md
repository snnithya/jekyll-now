<p>
Hi! I am a musician trained in Hindustani vocal music and a an engineering graduate with a B.E. in Computer Science from BITS Goa. Any combination of music and technology really excites me and so I spend most of my time working on this intersection. I am currently an R.A. under the guidance of Dr. Preeti Rao at IIT Bombay where we are studying the characteristics of raagas in a Jasrangi Jugalbandi.

I also sing and love exploring new kinds of music. I do some amateur recordings every once in a while (feel free to judge me on YouTube or Instagram :)). I am also slightly overly obessessed with dogs. I also draw sometimes and try to animate stuff (very amateurly of course). 
So feel free to hit me up if you want to talk about music, tech or even exchange dog pictures :)
